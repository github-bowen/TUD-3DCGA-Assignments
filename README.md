# 3D Computer Graphics and Animation Assignments (CS4515/IN4152) - TU Delft

This repository contains my work for the **3D Computer Graphics and Animation** course (CS4515/IN4152) at TU Delft. Below is the breakdown of the assignments and exercises included in this repository.

## Overview

The course is structured into multiple components including introductory exercises and two major assignments. This repository covers the exercises and the first assignment, which are all individual efforts. The final group project (Assignment 2) is linked separately at the end of this README.

## Contents

### 1. C++ Introduction and 4 Exercise Sets (Non-Graded)

The initial part of the course includes an introduction to C++ programming along with 4 exercise sets designed to build foundational skills in C++ and basic 3D graphics programming concepts. These exercises are not graded but are essential for building up the skills needed for the main assignments.

- **C++ Introduction Review**
- **Exercise Set 1 - Intro to OpenGL**
- **Exercise Set 2 - Blender and Animation**
- **Exercise Set 3 - Modern OpenGL**
- **Exercise Set 4 - Shadow Mapping**

### 2. Assignment 1 (60%)

This is an individual assignment consisting of three main components, each worth 20% of the total grade. The aim is to integrate skills learned through the exercises and develop new graphics methods.

#### 2.1. Part 1: Integration of Weekly Exercises (20%)

#### 2.2. Part 2: Physics Simulation (20%)

#### 2.3. Part 3: Diffusion Curves (20%)

### 3. Assignment 2 (Final Group Project) (40%)

The final group project is not included in this repository; it can be found [here]().
